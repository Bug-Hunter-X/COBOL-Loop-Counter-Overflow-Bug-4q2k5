This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in COBOL programs:  the lack of range checking for loop counters. The 'bug.cob' file contains code that iterates a loop and increments a counter.  While seemingly simple, if not handled carefully, this can lead to counter overflow issues. The 'bugSolution.cob' file presents a corrected version with comprehensive error handling and validation to prevent overflow. This example is useful for illustrating how seemingly small programming oversights can lead to significant runtime issues, especially in legacy systems.
